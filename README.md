# Description

This is my final project for a Web Programming course.

## Running my website in Docker
- You can run it locally on your machine:

Step 1: Navigate to the docker folder:

```terminal
cd docker
```
Step 2: Run the Docker command below:
```docker
docker-compose up -d
```
Step 3: Open your browser and go to:
```
localhost:8000
```

## Live version of the website
- You can contact me directly and I will start an AWS instance with a live version of my website.
